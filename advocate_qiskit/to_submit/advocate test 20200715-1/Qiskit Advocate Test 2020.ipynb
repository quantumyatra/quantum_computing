    "This is the Qiskit Advocate Test notebook. You will need to write and execute Qiskit code to answer several questions in this test. Once you have answered all the questions, you will need to submit the test for grading. You will be informed via email of you application outcome shortly after the end of application period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook only runs correctly using Jupyter notebook. It is currently incompatible with Jupyter lab.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this notebook, please follow these instructions.\n",
    "1. Run the cell below to install any dependencies of this notebook including `qiskit`, `metakernel`, `portalocker` and `matplotlib`. Make sure you install Qiskit version `0.19.6` for the test.\n",
    "1. Fill out your name in the `Personal Information` section below and run that cell. Make sure you get the output `Done`.\n",
    "1. To see the questions for each section, run the line that looks like `%activity questions/section`. You can go back and forth and select different answers. \n",
    "1. There are **30 questions** throughout this test. Your answers to each question are stored as soon as you select a choice, and are not erased if you re-start a section of questions.\n",
    "1. You can change your answers as many times as you'd like. All answers will be stored but **only the last answer will be graded**.\n",
    "1. To submit your answers, run the `Submit` cell. This will generate a file named `answers_yourname.zip`. Please attach this file to the advocate application form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reference materials for the test are [Qiskit Tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/index.html) and [Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/). In addtion, [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), [Coding with Qiskit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY), [Qiskit Live Circuit Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrRlVz7wqaqmaMZj_ZK2Afe) and [1 Minute Qiskit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvpOCmJ9BonUhf7NYB4d1p0e) are also good source of reference.
